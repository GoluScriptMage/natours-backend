2. Implement authentication using JWT.
3. Create routes and controllers for:
   - User authentication.
   - Expense CRUD operations.
   - Category management.
   - Analytics endpoints.
4. Test the API endpoints using Postman or similar tools.

### Frontend Tasks
1. Design the UI using React.
2. Implement forms for login, signup, and expense management.
3. Create components for:

   - Expense list
   - Analytics charts
4. Use state management (e.g., useReducer) for handling expenses.
5. Connect the frontend to the backend using Axios or Fetch API.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on core functionality first (authentication, expense CRUD, basic analytics).
- Use libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization.
- Keep the design simple and responsive.
- Test thoroughly to ensure smooth user experience.

## Future Enhancements
- Add budget tracking.
- Implement recurring expenses.
- Export data to CSV.
- Add notifications for overspending.

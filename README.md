# Natours Backend

A secure, scalable Node.js backend for tour booking and management APIs.

## Features

- JWT-based authentication & role-based authorization
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting, HTTP headers security, and sanitization (NoSQL injection/XSS)
- RESTful API for tours and users
- Centralized error handling with custom error classes
- Modular architecture with Express routers and middleware

## Technologies

- Node.js, Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- JWT, bcrypt
- Helmet, express-rate-limit, xss-clean, express-mongo-sanitize
- Nodemailer (email utilities)

Feel free to adjust the of the license section and add any extra badges or links as needed!The natours-backend project is a Node.js/Express backend application that focuses on secure authentication, authorization, and tour management APIs. The main flow centers around:

1. User Signup & Login:
   - Secure password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT token generation.
   - Login issues a new JWT via HTTP-only cookies.
2. Authentication Middleware:
   - Protects routes by validating JWTs, checking for password changes, and confirming user existence.
3. Authorization:
   - Role-based access control restricts API actions based on user roles.
4. Tour & User APIs:
   - Uses separate routers for tours and users, with middleware for security, rate limiting, data sanitization (against NoSQL injection/XSS), and error handling.

Supporting files include:
- app.js: Core Express setup, security middleware, route mounting, and error handling.
- utils/appError.js: Custom error class for consistent error responses.
- utils/email.js: Utility for sending emails (password resets, etc.) via nodemailer.
- short-tricky.md & technical-analysis.md: In-depth technical documentation and security reviews.
- public/: Static assets for frontend views.

AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)-like patterns appear mainly in the use of middleware for cross-cutting concerns (security, logging, error handling).

To update README.md:
- Summarize features: Secure authentication (JWT, bcrypt), robust error handling, security middleware (Helmet, rate limiting, XSS/NoSQL protection), RESTful routing, and role-based authorization.
- Outline the request flow: Incoming request → Middleware (security/logging/body parsing) → Route handlers (auth/tours/users) → Error handling.
- Highlight technical best practices: Use of environment variables, async/await, modular architecture, and extensible error handling.
- Link to technical-analysis.md and short-tricky.md for deeper code insights.
